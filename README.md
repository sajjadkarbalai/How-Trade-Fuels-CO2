# How-Trade-Fuels-CO2-
Analyzing the relationship between international trade and CO₂ consumption among the world’s top economies—USA, China, Germany, and the European Union. This data science project explores how trade volume correlates with carbon efficiency over time, using real-world datasets and Python visualizations.

The datasets used for this project are available online with the folowing links:

The visualizations aim to explore the link between economic activity (measured by total exports and
imports) and environmental cost (measured by consumption-based CO₂ emissions). The ϐirst set of
scatter plots visualizes how CO₂ emissions scale with total trade over time, using bubble sizes to indicate
either emissions per trade unit or total emissions. This provides an intuitive sense of both efficiency and
impact. The second set of line plots tracks the year-by-year trends of CO₂ emissions per $1 billion traded,
highlighting which countries are becoming carbon-efficient in their trade practices. Together, these
visualizations allow us to identify trends, compare countries, and assess whether economic growth is
being decoupled from environmental harm—an essential question in sustainable development.


China has undergone a dramatic transformation over the past few decades, evolving from one of the
world's smallest trading economies into the largest by total trade volume. In the early years of the dataset,
China lagged behind other countries like the USA and Germany in terms of export and import activity.
However, through rapid industrialization, investment in manufacturing, and integration into global supply
chains, China's trade surged—eventually surpassing all other economies analyzed. Interestingly, this
explosive growth initially came at a high environmental cost. China was the least efficient among the four
economies in terms of CO₂ emissions per dollar of trade, reϐlecting its heavy reliance on coal and energy-
intensive production. Over time, however, China has signiϐicantly improved its carbon efϐiciency, reducing
its CO₂ emissions per $1 billion of trade. This improvement suggests a shift toward cleaner technologies,
better energy standards, and a growing focus on environmental responsibility alongside economic
growth.
